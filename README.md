**Full Stack Developer: Ruby on Rails | React**

I currently work for the *Texas State University - School Safety Center* as a **Programmer Analyst** (2022 - present).

Most of my work has involved rewriting and upgrading legacy web applications.  I enjoy the problem-solving aspect of revamping older applications and giving them new life in the constantly evolving world of tech.  

My work involves walking the line between "what functionality must be preserved?" and "what can we innovate and improve upon?".  I also get plenty of opportunities to build out feature requests for users, both internal and public.

Edit: Oh how far we've come 😅. Leaving this up as a reminder of when I first began my coding journey back in '21!
